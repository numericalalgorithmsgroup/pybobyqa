Py-BOBYQA
====

Py-BOBYQA is a general-purpose minimizer which only requires function values.
It is a Python implementation of BOBYQA (Powell, 2009).

It solves the problem:
    min_{x}  f(x),
subject to the (optional) bounds
    lb <= x <= ub,
where f(x) is differentiable and possibly nonconvex.
Since the derivatives of f(x) are never required or approximated,
the solver works when the evaluation of f(x) is noisy.
